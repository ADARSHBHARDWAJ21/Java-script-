## 4 pillars
ABSTRACTION
ENCAPSULATION
INHERITANCE
POLYMORPHISM

* **Inheritance** → One class takes features from another (like children inherit traits from parents).
* **Abstraction** → Show only what is needed, hide the extra details (like driving a car without knowing engine details).
* **Polymorphism** → Same thing can work in different ways (like one word "run" means run fast, run a program, run a business).
* **Encapsulation** → Keep data safe by wrapping it inside a class (like medicine packed in a capsule)
